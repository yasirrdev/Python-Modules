# 🐍 Python Learning Modules

This repository contains a collection of Python modules developed as part of my learning journey.
Each module focuses on a specific Python concept, ranging from basic error handling to advanced
data processing techniques used in data engineering and analytics.

The goal of this repository is to **practice Python fundamentals in a structured and progressive way**
using real-world inspired exercises.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each module is organized into its own directory and contains multiple exercises:

```
module_xx/
├── ex0/
├── ex1/
├── ex2/
├── ex3/
├── ex4/
├── ex5/
└── ex6/
```

Each exercise is self-contained and focuses on mastering a specific concept.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Error Handling & Exceptions
- Try / Except / Finally blocks
- Custom exception classes
- Raising and catching errors properly
- Graceful program recovery

### 🔹 Python Data Structures
- Lists: analytics, statistics, filtering
- Tuples: immutable data (coordinates, positions)
- Sets: unique collections and set operations
- Dictionaries: inventory systems and nested data

### 🔹 Advanced Python Features
- Generators and `yield` for memory-efficient streams
- List, dict, and set comprehensions
- Command-line argument processing (`sys.argv`)

## 🧪 Learning Philosophy

- Focus on **clarity over complexity**
- Use **realistic data scenarios**
- Avoid unnecessary features
- Follow Python best practices
- Learn by building, breaking, and fixing

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Exercises

Each exercise can be run independently from the command line:

```bash
python3 file_name.py [arguments]
```

Example:

```bash
python3 ft_score_analytics.py 1500 2300 1800 2100
```

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repository will continue to grow as new modules and exercises are added.
Refactoring and improvements may happen as my Python skills evolve.
